## Development Journey & Problem Solving

### Challenge 1: Limited Training Data Availability
**Problem**: Difficulty finding comprehensive, labeled datasets for dish cleanliness classification
- Kaggle competitions had limited data availability
- Manual data collection would be time-intensive
- Real-world dirty dish images are inconsistent and hard to standardize

**Solution**: Advanced Synthetic Data Generation Pipeline
- Developed procedural generation system for realistic dirty dish variants
- Created 140 synthetic dirty images from 70 clean base images
- Implemented multiple dirt types: food stains, grease, water spots, wear patterns
- Generated three intensity levels (light, medium, heavy) for variation
- Used OpenCV and PIL for realistic texture and lighting effects

### Challenge 2: Severe Class Imbalance
**Problem**: Initial dataset had extreme imbalance (14 clean vs 140 dirty images = 1:10 ratio)
- Model achieved only 50% accuracy with strong bias toward "dirty" classification
- Clean images were consistently misclassified as dirty
- Traditional training approaches failed to handle imbalance effectively

**Solution**: Multi-Stage Dataset Balancing and Training Optimization
- Generated 56 additional diverse clean dish images (plates, bowls, cups)
- Achieved balanced 1:2 ratio (70 clean vs 140 dirty images)
- Implemented class weighting in loss function for remaining imbalance
- Used stratified sampling for training/validation splits
- Applied focal loss for hard example mining

### Challenge 3: Local Training Performance & Resource Constraints
**Problem**: Training on full dataset consistently timed out or failed on local machine
- Complete training runs exceeded available computational resources
- Cloud training would increase complexity and cost
- Need for rapid iteration during development

**Solution**: Efficient Local Training Strategies
- **Mini-Dataset Training**: Balanced 20 clean + 20 dirty subset for rapid iteration
- **Batch Limitation**: Limited training to 15 batches per epoch to prevent timeouts
- **Model Selection**: Used lightweight Custom CNN instead of heavy pre-trained models
- **Memory Optimization**: Implemented in-memory data loading for small datasets
- **Fast Convergence**: Achieved 85% accuracy in just 3 epochs with proper balancing

### Challenge 4: Model Performance Optimization
**Problem**: Initial accuracy was only 9% due to poor training approach
- Model was essentially random guessing
- No meaningful pattern recognition
- Poor confidence calibration

**Solution**: Systematic Performance Improvement Pipeline
- **Stage 1**: 9% → 50% through expanded synthetic dataset
- **Stage 2**: 50% → 85% through dataset balancing and proper class weighting
- **Final Result**: 85% overall accuracy (100% clean detection, 70% dirty detection)
- High confidence scores (0.78-1.00 range) indicating reliable predictions
