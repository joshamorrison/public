```

## Output Examples

### Executive Summary
```
EXECUTIVE SUMMARY - GDP GROWTH

Current Situation:
Real GDP currently stands at 21,427.02 (Index). Our econometric analysis indicates 
the indicator has shown moderate momentum in recent periods with a quarterly growth 
rate of 2.1%.

Forecast Outlook:
Over the next 12 months, we forecast GDP will increase by approximately 3.2%. 
This projection is based on ARIMA(2,1,1) modeling with high confidence intervals.

Key Implications:
- The predicted trajectory suggests continued economic expansion
- Businesses should maintain optimistic planning assumptions
- Investment opportunities remain favorable in the current environment

Risk Assessment:
Model uncertainty and potential external shocks represent manageable risks. 
The high confidence level reflects stable underlying economic fundamentals.
```

### Demand Planning Report
```
DEMAND PLANNING EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

Economic Environment Impact:
Based on current economic forecasts, we anticipate a stable demand environment with moderate 
growth potential. GDP indicators suggest steady expansion while employment levels remain 
supportive of consumer spending.

Demand Scenario Analysis:
• Economic Stability (60% probability): Stable demand with 2-3% growth
• Economic Growth (25% probability): Increased demand by 8-12%  
• Economic Slowdown (15% probability): Decreased demand by 5-8%

Customer Segment Insights:
• Price-Sensitive Consumers: High sensitivity to economic changes
• Premium Customers: Low sensitivity, maintain quality preferences
• B2B Customers: Moderate sensitivity, procurement cycle dependent

Strategic Recommendations:
- Maintain flexible inventory strategies to adapt to scenario outcomes
- Focus on operational efficiency in the base case scenario
- Prepare scaling capabilities for growth scenarios
- Develop cost optimization plans for slowdown scenarios
