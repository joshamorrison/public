# AutoML Agent

Automated machine learning system that handles end-to-end model development. Users upload datasets and the system performs EDA, data munging, feature engineering, optimal model selection, and hyperparameter tuning. CrewAI orchestrates specialist agents for different ML tasks while LangSmith tracks experiments and model performance across the entire pipeline.
